					<h2>Who am I?</h2>
					<p>My name is Tito and I am half Italian.</p>
    	    <p>
    	      The dog-savvy folks out there will know from my picture that I am a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.
    	    </p>
    	    <p>
    	      These dogs were originally bred as lap dogs to keep people warm in the days before everybody had central heating.
    	    </p>
    	    <p>
    	      I consider myself very good at my job! I absolutely love sitting on or near my owner.

    		  <h2>My favourite foods</h2>
    		  <p>
    		    I really love food (of course). Eggs are my fav, especially fried eggs. YUM! I love ham and tuna as well.
					</p>
					<p>(I'll let you in on a secret... I am also a big fan of pasta.)</p>
