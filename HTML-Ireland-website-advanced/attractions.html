	     <p>
	       There are lots of places to go and see in Ireland.
	       Here is a small selection!

    		  <h2>The Cliffs of Moher</h2>
    	    <p>The Cliffs of Moher are found in County Clare, where I am from. They are well worth a visit - look how cool they are!</p>

    		  <h2>The Burren</h2>
    		  <p>The Burren is an area in County Clare and Galway covered in 
    		  unusual limestone rock formations. It was formed by glaciers 
    		  moving along the landscape, carving out paths in the soft rock.
    		  You can walk for miles along limestone pavements: large flat 
    		  rocks separated by deep crevasses.
    		  </p>

    	      <p>The limestone pavements stretch out for files. It's fun to jump across the rocks!</p>
    	    </a>
    		  <p>The Burren has its own special wildlife and plant life due to having
    		  a climate that's different from the rest of Ireland. You can see flowers
    		  there that don't grow anywhere else in the countryside. You must not pick 
    		  them, because the landscape is protected.

    		 <p>This is like a zoo with a difference. You walk along paths that go 
    		 through fields of giraffes, you might see a lemur hanging out in a nearby
    		 tree as you pass by a flock of penguins.</p>

  		  <h2>Newgrange</h2>
  		  <p>Newgrange is famous for its <strong>passage tomb</strong>.
  		  A narrow tunnel leads to the centre of man-made hill. Somebody important
  		  was buried there thousands of years ago and the people made this tomb for 
  		  them. The ceiling and walls are made entirely of flat pieces of rock stacked
  		  on top of each other. On one morning every year, at the Winter Solstice,
  		  the rising sun lights up the tunnel all the way to the chamber in the 
  		  middle.</p>
